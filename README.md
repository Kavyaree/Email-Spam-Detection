Email spam detection is a critical process aimed at identifying and filtering unsolicited or unwanted emails from legitimate ones. Using various techniques such as machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and pattern recognition, spam detection systems analyze email content, sender reputation, and metadata to classify messages as either spam or non-spam. These systems play a vital role in safeguarding users from phishing attempts, malware distribution, and other malicious activities, thereby ensuring the security and integrity of communication channels.
